# MySQL Projects Overview

This repository showcases a wide range of SQL techniques applied in practical scenarios. It demonstrates foundational database design skills through the creation of normalized tables, the use of primary keys, auto-increment fields, and the establishment of relationships between tables. Data retrieval is handled using standard SELECT queries combined with conditional filtering, sorting, and table joins to extract meaningful insights.

The projects incorporate aggregation functions such as SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, and COUNT to analyze datasets, often grouped by specific fields using GROUP BY and refined with HAVING clauses. More advanced logic is applied using CASE statements to categorize records dynamically, and string functions like CONCAT to enhance output readability.

Beyond basic querying, the repository includes procedural SQL techniques through stored procedures and user-defined functions. These are used to encapsulate logic for evaluating player performance, converting units, and calculating BMI. Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and subqueries are employed to simplify complex analyses, such as identifying statistical leaders or filtering based on dynamic averages.

Overall, the projects simulate real-world use cases, from HR data analysis to NBA player performance evaluation, and highlighting how SQL can be used not just for data storage, but also for generating insights and solving business problems.
